        <h5><b>Overview</b></h5>
        This is a collection of projects I've worked on that I think are particularly cool.  Whether created for class
        projects, formal research, or just for fun (and practice), I hope you find them as interesting as I did.

            <div id="mylan" class="content active">
              <p>
                While I was toying around with topics to analyze on Twitter, a friend of mine who works for Mylan, Dan Piett, 
                pointed me towards the stories that were flying around about bidding wars between three generic pharmaceutical
                companies: Mylan, Perrigo, and Teva.  Mylan is a pillar of the Morgantown community, so their being bought out
                would be huge news in Morgantown.
              </p>
              <p>
                We pulled the most recent tweets with the hashtag #Mylan and performed sentiment analysis to see what the Twittersphere
                had to say about the generics wars.

            <a href = "#usgs">USGS Seismic Data</a>
            <div id="usgs" class="content">
            	<p>
            	  These projects were created from data pulled from the U.S. Geological Survey's 
            	  <a href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/search/" target="_blank"> Earthquake Archives</a>.
            	  The data set includes information about 20,000 global seismic events that occured from January 1, 2015 to
            	  April 15, 2015.
            	</p>
            	<h5><b>Interactive Map</b></h5>
            	<p>
            	  First, I created an interactive map showing the location of the seismic events using 
            	  <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/" target="_blank">RStudio</a>'s 
            	  <a href="http://shiny.rstudio.com/" target="_blank">Shiny</a> package.  Each point represents one event. 
            	  Events are colored according to event type (earthquake, exposion, etc.) and scaled by magnitude.  
            	  Because plotting all the events takes a while, the map is restricted to the 8,480 events which occured
            	  in the six weeks of March 1, 2015 - April 15, 2015.
            	</p>
            	<p>
            	  The map can be found here: 
            	  <a href="http://raffled.shinyapps.io/seismic" target="_blank">http://raffled.shinyapps.io/seismic</a>
            	</p>
            	<p>
            	  Please note that this is very much a work in progress, so your patience with bugs is appreciated.
            	  The map also seems to hang up a bit in Firefox and Internet Explorer, so I'd recommend running it
            	  in Chrome.
            	</p>
            	<h5><b>Exploratory Data Analysis</b></h5>
            	<p>
            	  This is a basic exploration of the USGS data set, written in R Markdown, including numerical and
            	  graphical summaries of the data set.
            	</p>
            	<p>
            	  Check out the EDA <a href = "docs/seismicEDA.html" target = "_blank">here</a>.
            	</p>
            	<h5><b>Predictive Modelling</b></h5>
            	<h6>Classification</h6>
            	<p>
            	  First, I wanted to play around with some classification models.  This is less of a technical report and more of a 
            	  comparison of how different methods work for this data.  The modelling is particularly challenging because of the 
            	  context of the problem: 96.4% of the observations are of the same class.
            	</p>
            	<p>
            	  You can see the results <a href = "docs/seismicModelling.html" target = "_blank">here</a>.

      	    <a href="#wvdp">West Virginia Dialect Project</a>
      	    <div id="wvdp" class="content">
      	      <p>
                During the summer of 2014, I worked with Dr. Kirk Hazen and the 
                <a href="http://dialects.english.wvu.edu/" target="_blank">West Virginia Dialect Project</a>.
                The focus at the time was in the voicing of alveolar fricatives.  Basically, we wanted to find which
                sociolinguistic variables, if any, differentiate Appalachians' creation of "s" and "z" sounds.
              </p>
              <p>
                The data set contained 2,437 distinct observations of words containing "s" or "z" sounds recorded from
                sixty-seven individuals from across West Virginia, Soutwestern Pennsylvania, and Southeastern Ohio. 
                This paper summarizes my summer work and includes the exploratory data analysis and some descriptive modelling.
                All analysis was conducted with R, and source code is included in the appendix.
