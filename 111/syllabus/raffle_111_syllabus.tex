%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Grading %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\textbf{Grading Policies:} Final letter grades are based on the total number
of points earned out of a possible 400 as follows:
\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{rl}
  A: & 360--400 points\\
  B: & 320--359 points\\
  C: & 280--319 points\\
  D: & 240--279 points\\
  F: & $<$ 239 points\\
\end{tabular}\end{center}

\textbf{Course Assessments:} Points earned towards the final total are
based on a final exam, homework assignments, quizzes, and lab assignments.
\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{l r r}
  & \multicolumn{2}{c}{\textbf{Points}} \\\hline
  \textbf{Assessment} & \textbf{Each} & \textbf{Total}\\\hline
  Assignments (10) & 10 & 100\\
  Quizzes (5) & 20 & 100\\
  Lab Assignments (5) & 20 & 100 \\
  Final Exam &  & 100 \\\hline
  \textbf{Grand Total} & & \textbf{400}\\
\end{tabular}\\\end{center}

\textbf{Assessment Details:}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Assignments} will require students to implement and
    discuss the techniques presented in this course.  All homework
    assignments are assigned through MyStatLab.  There will be a total
    of twelve homeworks assigned (two per week) and students will be
    graded on the best ten.
  \item \textbf{Quizzes:} At least six quizzes will be given throughout the
    course of the session (typically at the start of lab sessions).
    Students will be evaluated on the best five.
  \item \textbf{Labs Assignments:} Lab assignments will be require
    students to analyze real data sets and summarize the results of
    these analyses.  Lab 
    assignments need to be completed during the lab session to receive
    credit unless otherwise specified. At least six lab assignments will be
    given and students graded on the best five.
  \item \textbf{Final Exam:} At the end of the session a comprehensive
    final exam will be given to assess students' mastery of
    topics covered.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Course Schedule:} Assignments will become available in
MyStatLab as topics are covered.  The schedule on my website will also
be constantly updated.\\

\textbf{Attendance/Make-up Policy:} Attendance will not be taken, but poor
lecture attendance in this course nearly always results in low grades.
Make-ups will not be given for missed lab assignments or quizzes.  If
you need to miss a lab for any reason, the missed assignment and quiz
will count as your drops.\\
