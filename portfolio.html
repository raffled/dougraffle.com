            This is a collection of projects I've worked on that I think are
            particularly cool.  Whether created for class projects, formal research,
            or just for fun (and practice). Feel free to browse the projects on
            my <a href="http://github.com/raffled" target="_blank">GitHub</a> page,
            or take the guided tour of selected projects below.  Direct links to the
            formatted documents (Shiny apps, knitted HTML, or PDF) are provided, as
            well as to the specific repositories containing the source code.

		  For any company, better understanding of its customers can give a
		  competitive edge when negotiating contracts.  This app, inspired
		  by my time at Mylan (but created on my own time with simulated
		  data), is designed as a tool to help understand 
		  customers based on their purchasing behavior and history.
		</p>
		<p>
		  Included in the app are tools for clustering customers based on
		  their contract history and analyzing their purchasing behavior
		  based on market position and types of products bought.  There's a
		  detailed readme within the app itself describing these tools in
		  more detail.

		  I designed this workbook while teaching Business Stats at CalU
		  as part of a discussion on displaying and analyzing categorical
		  data.  Nothing gets undergrads interested like death and disaster,
		  so I pulled public data on the passengers of the Titanic.
		</p>
		<p>
		  While discussion and conclusions were left up to the students, I
		  designed plots that summarized the individual variables as well as
		  plots showing relationships between two and three variables.

		  While I was toying around with topics to analyze on Twitter in
		  grad school, a friend of mine who works for Mylan pointed me
		  towards the stories that were flying around about bidding wars
		  between three generic pharmaceutical companies: Mylan, Perrigo,
		  and Teva.  Mylan is a pillar of the Morgantown community, so their
		  being bought out would be huge news in Morgantown.
		</p>
		<p>
		  We pulled the most recent tweets with the hashtag #Mylan on April
		  24, 2015 and performed sentiment analysis to see what the
		  Twittersphere had to say about the generics wars.

		</a>
		<p>
		  The data set includes information about 20,000 global seismic
		  events that occured from January 1, 2015 to April 15, 2015.  Links
		  to the final projects are provided, and all of the source code can
		  be found on
		  <a href="https://github.com/raffled/seismic/" target="_blank">
		    GitHub
		  </a>.
		</p>
		<h5><b>Interactive Map</b></h5>
		<p>
		  First, I created an interactive map showing the location of the
		  seismic events using  
		  <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/" target="_blank">
		    RStudio's
		  </a>
		  <a href="http://shiny.rstudio.com/" target="_blank">
		    Shiny
		  </a>
		  package.  Each point represents one event. Events are colored
		  according to event type (earthquake, exposion, etc.) and scaled by
		  magnitude.   Because plotting all the events takes a while, the
		  map is restricted to the 8,480 events which occured 
		  in the six weeks of March 1, 2015 - April 15, 2015.
		</p>
		<p>
		  Click on the image to the left to access the map.
		</p>
		<p>
		  Please note that this is very much a work in progress, so your
		  patience with bugs is appreciated. The map also seems to hang up a
		  bit in Firefox and Internet Explorer, so I'd recommend running it 
		  in Chrome.
		</p>
		<h5><b>Exploratory Data Analysis</b></h5>
		<p>
		  This is a basic exploration of the USGS data set, written in R
		  Markdown, including numerical and graphical summaries of the data set.

		</a>
		<h5><b>Predictive Modelling</b></h5>
		<h6>Classification</h6>
		<p>
		  First, I wanted to play around with some classification models, so
		  I wanted to see if the three variable describing the seismic 
		  event could be used to predict the type of event. While not a
		  practical problem (if there's a large seismic even near me, I care
		  more about the magnitude than what caused it), it is particularly
		  challenging because of the  nature of the data: 96.4% of the
		  observations are earthquakes.  I tuned several different models
		  and compared their results.

      		  For an assignment in a data visualization class, we were tasked

		  During the summer of 2014, I worked with Dr. Kirk Hazen and the 
		  <a href="http://dialects.english.wvu.edu/" target="_blank">
		    West Virginia Dialect Project
		  </a>.
		  The focus at the time was in the voicing of alveolar fricatives.
		  Basically, we wanted to find which sociolinguistic variables, if
		  any, differentiate Appalachians' creation of "s" and "z" sounds. 
		</p>
		<p>
		  The data set contained 2,437 distinct observations of words
		  containing "s" or "z" sounds recorded from sixty-seven individuals
		  from across West Virginia, Soutwestern Pennsylvania, and
		  Southeastern Ohio.  This paper summarizes my summer work and
		  includes the exploratory data analysis and some descriptive
		  modeling. All analysis was conducted with R, and source code is
		  included in the appendix.
