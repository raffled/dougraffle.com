Graphically analyze using `ggvis` the 1970 Boston housing dataset. This dataset consists of 14 variables with 506 observations. The target variable, `medv`, is the median owner-occupied home value in 1000's of dollars. The Boston dataset is found in the `MASS` package. 
```{r}
library(MASS)
data(Boston)
Boston$chas <-factor(Boston$chas, levels = c(0,1),
                     labels = c("Not on River", "On River"))
Boston$rad <-factor(Boston$rad)
head(Boston)
```

The fit of a linear model to `log(medv)` using select predictors is:
```{r label=setup.data}
attach(Boston)
Boston.lm <- lm(log(medv) ~ crim + chas + rad + lstat)
summary(Boston.lm)
```
All variables are highly significant.

See the variable descriptions using `help` in the `MASS` package.

In each of the following plots, **label the axes appropriately**.

## 1. Plot the boxplot distributions of the log of the median home values (`log_medv = log(medv)`) by the Charles River (`chas`) and separately by radial highway locations (`rad`). Draw horizontal lines at `mean(log(medv))` in each plot. Discuss each plot.

```{r label=load.libs}
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
library(ggvis)
```
```{r label=boxplot.logmedv.by.chas}
Boston %>% ggvis(~chas, ~log(medv)) %>% layer_boxplots(fill = ~chas)
```

The distribution of the log-transformed median prices for riverfront homes is higher
than that of other properties and skewed slightly to the right.

The non-riverfront properties have more outliers, especially on the
low side, giving us a slight left skew.

Note that the functionality to add horizontal lines to boxplots
doesn't seem to be fully implemented yet.

```{r label=boxplot.logmedv.by.rad}
Boston %>% ggvis(~rad, ~log(medv)) %>% layer_boxplots(fill = ~rad)
```

Increasing the radial highway index
generally increases the median home value.  However, the
boxplots now reveal a more subtle pattern -- there are two distinct
increasing trends: from 1 to 3 and from 4 to 8. If the two groups are
considered as a whole, we see no overall trend. 

We also see that the distribution of median home values is lowest for
homes with an index of 24.  This group also has the most variability.
Again, this may point to median house prices in towns in a city center
being confounded with income.

## 2. Explore graphically the relationship of log crime (`log_crim = log(crim)`) to the log of the median home values (`log_medv`). Add the linear model fit and a smoothed fit with their standard error bands. Do you see any difficulties in using `log_crim` as a predictor? 
```{r label=transform}
Boston <- Boston %>%
    transform(log_crim = log(crim)) %>%
    transform(log_medv = log(medv))
```
```{r label=logmedv.by.logcrim.smoothed}
Boston %>% ggvis(~log_crim, ~log_medv) %>%
    layer_smooths(se=TRUE, stroke := "blue") %>%
    layer_model_predictions(model="lm", se=TRUE, stroke := "red") %>%
    layer_points()
```
The biggest apparent issue with regressing `log_medv` on `log_crim` is
the non-linear relationship.  When `log_crim` $<1$, we have decent
linear relationships, albeit with a fair few outliers.  Once we hit
the subset of `log_crime` $ > 1$, however, the relationship
dramatically changes and the slope becomes much steeper.  This may
suggest a confounding variable, or a quadratic relationship overall
and warrants further investigation.

## 3. Explore graphically the relationship of log crime (`log_crim`) to the log of the median home values (`log_medv`) as in 2.
### a) Fill (color) the points according to the radial highway locations (`rad`). Group by `rad` and fit linear models. Does there appear to be an interaction between `rad` and `log_crim`? Discuss.
```{r label=logmedv.by.logcrim.by.rad}
Boston %>% ggvis(~log_crim, ~log_medv) %>%
    layer_points(fill = ~rad) %>%
    group_by(rad) %>%
    layer_model_predictions(model="lm", se=TRUE, stroke = ~rad)
```

Coloring points by `rad` illuminates the issues mentioned in
problem 2.  We can see that most of the slopes are relatively similar,
with two major exceptions, telling us we have an interaction.

When `rad` $=8$ we actually see a positive linear relationship, which
was buried in the noise of the full data set above.  This could again
be caused by yet a fourth variable, or simply noise because of our
small sample sizes. Subsetting the data and comparing points by
`chas` offers no explanation.  Either this radial highway score
naturally changes our relationship, or we have a confounding variable
other than `chas`.

```{r label=logmedv.by.logcrim.by.rad.subset}
summary(rad)
Boston %>% filter(rad == 8) %>%
    ggvis(~log_crim, ~log_medv) %>%
    layer_points(fill = ~chas)
```

Most telling, however, is what we see when `rad` $=24$. This subset
makes up almost the entirety of the problems discussed in question 2.
We can see that the change in slope once `log_crim` $> 1$ is in fact
interaction with `rad` rather than a quadratic relationship.

### b) Fill (color) the points according to the Charles River (`chas`). Group by `chas` and fit linear models. Does there appear to be an interaction between `chas` and `log_crim`? Discuss.
```{r label=logmedv.by.logcrim.by.chas}
Boston %>% ggvis(~log_crim, ~log_medv) %>%
    layer_points(fill = ~chas) %>%
    group_by(chas) %>%
    layer_model_predictions(model="lm", se=TRUE)
```

We do see some interaction in that the slopes are different, but this
is hard to say with any certainty since `chas= "On River"` is such a
small sample size in comparison to its complement.  Overall the slope
seems to be similar (the orange points fitting well inside of the
blue), but a few influential outliers in the top-right of the
plot are likely throwing the slope off.

```{r label=chas.counts}
summary(chas)
```

## 4. To see how the the log crime variable (`crim`) depends on `rad` and `chas`, **make the x-axis scales equal** and:  
### a) Plot the density curve of the log of crime (`log_crim`).
```{r label=density}
domain <- range(Boston$log_crim)*1.3
Boston %>% ggvis(~log_crim) %>%
    layer_densities() %>%
    scale_numeric("x", domain = domain, nice = TRUE)
```

It seems like we have a mixture of two distinct normal distributions
within the distribution of `log_crim`.

### b) Plot the density curve of  log crime (`lob_crim`) grouped by and filled (coloured) by the radial highway locations (`rad`). Discuss differences due highway locations and compare to the plot in a).
```{r label=density.by.rad}
Boston %>% ggvis(~log_crim) %>%
    group_by(rad) %>%
    layer_densities(fill=~rad) %>%
    scale_numeric("x", domain = domain, nice = TRUE)
```

While there is certainly some variation in the distributions when
`rad` $< 24$, they are mostly centered around $-4 \le$ `log_crim` 
$< 1$. Again, given the small sizes of most of these subsets
coming to a concrete conclusion is difficult.

What is distinct, however, is the crime is substantially higher when
`rad` $= 24$, and that this distribution seems to line up with the
higher mean of the mixture in the overall distribution.

### c) Plot the density curve of  log crime (`lob_crim`) grouped by and filled (coloured) by the Charles River (`chas`). Discuss differences due to Charles River and compare to the plot in a).
```{r label=density.by.chas}
Boston %>% ggvis(~log_crim) %>%
    group_by(chas) %>%
    layer_densities(fill=~chas) %>%
    scale_numeric("x", domain = domain, nice = TRUE)
```
When separating by `chas`, we see that `"Not on River"` is an almost
perfect mirror of the aggregate data. `"On River"` is still bimodal,
but the distinction is much less profound.

## 5. Explore the effect of `lstat` on the median home (`log_medv`) by:
### a) Plotting percent lower status (`lstat`) relative to the log of the median home (`log_medv`) with points coloured (filled) by the radial highway locations (`rad`). Add the linear fits and standard errors grouped by `rad`. Discuss the efficacy of the fits and whether or not there appears to be an interaction between `lstat` and `rad`.
```{r label=logmedv.by.lstat.by.rad}
Boston %>% ggvis(~lstat, ~log_medv) %>%
    layer_points(fill = ~rad) %>%
    group_by(rad) %>%
    layer_model_predictions(model="lm", se=TRUE, stroke = ~rad)
```
While we have some slight differences in the fits between `rad`
levels, most slopes are fairly similar and all show a fairly strong
negative linear relationship between the variables.

When `rad=6` we can see the slope mitigated, while the opposite occurs
when `rad=1`. As with other analyses for this dataset, these
differences should be tempered by the fact that these subsets have
sizes of $20$ and $24$, respectively. Accounting for an interaction
may slightly improve our model accuracy, but I'm not sure it'd be
worth the loss of simplicity.

### b)  Plotting percent lower status (`lstat`) relative to the log of the median home (`log_medv`) with points coloured (filled) by the Charles River (`chas`). Add the linear fits and standard errors grouped by `chas`. Discuss the efficacy of the fits and whether or not there appears to be an interaction between `lstat` and `chas`.
```{r label=logmedv.by.lstat.by.chas}
Boston %>% ggvis(~lstat, ~log_medv) %>%
    layer_points(fill = ~chas) %>%
    group_by(chas) %>%
    layer_model_predictions(model="lm", se=TRUE, stroke = ~chas)
```

Here we see almost perfectly parallel slopes.  While accounting for
`chas` in the model is probably a good idea, there is no significant
interaction.

```{r label=cleanup, echo=FALSE}
detach(Boston)
```
